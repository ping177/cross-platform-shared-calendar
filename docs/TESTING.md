# Testing

## Current Smoke-Test Status

- Passed: local production build.
- Passed: Supabase schema, RPC, RLS, and Realtime validation.
- Passed: two-user desktop flow for space creation/join and event create/update/delete.
- Passed: third-user capacity rejection and non-member RLS read/write isolation.
- Passed: iOS Safari layout and add-to-home-screen behavior.
- Passed: Android Chrome layout and creation of a home-screen shortcut.
- Pending: Android Magic Link login.
- Pending: viewing, creating, editing, and deleting events after login on Android.
- Pending reason: the Android device is temporarily unavailable. Earlier attempts were also interrupted by Supabase's default email frequency limit and a Site URL that had incorrectly remained set to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Local Build

- Run:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Expected result: TypeScript and Vite production build pass.

## Supabase Schema

- Execute `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.
- Confirm tables, indexes, triggers, RLS policies, and RPC functions are created.
- Confirm RLS is enabled for `profiles`, `spaces`, `space_members`, and `events`.
- Confirm `public.generate_invite_code()` can create a code without a `gen_random_bytes` lookup error.
- Confirm PostgREST can query `space_members` with `profiles(display_name)` through the direct profile foreign key.
- Confirm `public.events` is included in the `supabase_realtime` publication.
- Confirm `public.events` uses `replica identity full` so filtered DELETE events include `space_id`.

## Magic Link

- Configure Supabase Auth redirect URLs for local development and deployment domains.
- Request a Magic Link from the login page.
- Open the email link on desktop and mobile.
- Confirm the app restores the Supabase session after redirect.

## Two-User Flow

- User A creates a shared space.
- User A copies the invite code.
- User B joins with the invite code.
- User A creates, edits, and deletes an event.
- User B creates, edits, and deletes an event.
- Confirm both users can see shared updates.
- Keep User B open while User A creates an event, and confirm it appears without refreshing.
- Delete the event in User B's session and confirm it disappears from User A's session without refreshing.
- Confirm "我的", "对方的", and "共同的" labels render correctly from each user's perspective.

## Space Capacity

- User C tries to join the already full space.
- Expected result: the join RPC returns a clear error and User C is not added.

## RLS Isolation

- A non-member attempts to read spaces, members, and events.
- Expected result: non-members cannot read or modify private space data.

## Mobile Browsers

- Test on iOS Safari.
- Test on Android Chrome.
- Confirm login, onboarding, event creation, event editing, event deletion, and calendar navigation work on narrow screens.

## PWA

- Open the app on mobile.
- Add it to the home screen.
- Launch from the home screen.
- Confirm the app opens with standalone PWA presentation where supported.
