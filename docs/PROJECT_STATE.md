## Current version

v0.1.7.3.3.2 (Frontend Scope Integration)

## Current status

v0.1.7.3.3.2 已完成并部署到 Production。重复 occurrence 的「仅修改当前事件 / 修改当前及未来事件 / 仅删除当前事件 / 删除当前及未来事件」已通过 Production Desktop 与 iPhone Standalone PWA recurrence smoke。

## Latest completed

v0.1.7.3.3.2 adds a compact EventSheet action chooser only after a recurring occurrence save/delete is requested. It supports only-this and this-and-future edit/delete through the approved RPCs, preserving source `all_day`, `recurrence_rule`, and `updated_at`; successful mutations reload events and exceptions before projection. Node regression, production build, authenticated local smoke, and final Production Desktop plus iPhone Standalone PWA recurrence smoke all passed. `delete_logical_series` remains available only as a backend RPC: its UI is deliberately deferred.

## Deployment

Status: public_deployed
Public URL: https://cross-platform-shared-calendar.vercel.app/
Provider: Vercel
Backend: Supabase Free
Notes: 已完成公网部署，用于真实设备访问和跨端验收。

## Next Action

Commit the completed v0.1.7.3.3.2 implementation and documentation when ready. Keep `delete_logical_series` without a frontend entry point until a separately approved product slice.

## Blockers

No code blocker. Production Desktop and iPhone Standalone PWA recurrence acceptance is complete. Two-session Realtime and DST-zone behavior remain separate verification work.

## Important Context

- Git branch、latest commit、working tree 由 project-command-center 实时 Git 扫描读取；PROJECT_STATE.md 不作为这些字段的权威来源。
- Production URL: `https://cross-platform-shared-calendar.vercel.app/`.
- Supabase project status is currently Active, but Free Tier inactivity pause remains an operational risk.
- A Supabase pause may affect Auth, Database, RLS, and Realtime until the project is restored.
- Vercel Cron 每天调用 `/api/supabase-keepalive`；每次调用连续执行 3 次极轻量、只读、无业务副作用的数据库检查；首次 Production Cron 已返回 HTTP 200 并完成验证。
- Keep-alive is active, but its long-term effectiveness against inactivity pauses still requires observation.
- Continue using Supabase Cloud for now; do not upgrade to Pro or migrate the backend unless real usage requires it.
- README is the project entrypoint; detailed smoke checklists and production validation records live in `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Android compatibility smoke test is complete for Xiaomi 14 / Android 16 / Chrome on mobile network.
- v0.1 is a Web/PWA, not native iOS / Android.
- Event ownership uses stable `scope + owner_user_id`; UI labels are derived from the current user.
- Personal events are visible to both members but only editable/deletable by the owner.
- Existing event identity fields must not change: `space_id`, `created_by`, `scope`, `owner_user_id`.
- Supabase RLS and database triggers remain the final permission boundary.
- v0.1.4 uses only `profiles.display_name`, which is nullable and constrained to trimmed 1–20-character values. UI fallback is 「成员」; shared remains 「共同」.
- New profiles default to a null display name, never an Auth metadata or email-derived public name.
- No `space_members.nickname`, no profile/member Realtime subscription, and no RLS policy changes were added. A name change updates the saving device immediately; other sessions refresh/re-enter to see it.
- The current Production Supabase patch and SQL/RLS verification passed on 2026-07-11. Local two-account desktop smoke and deployed-frontend Production desktop smoke passed.
- Resend SMTP + Supabase Auth passwordless template deliver 8-digit Email OTP in Production. Email OTP removes Magic Link return handling; Safari and standalone PWA retain separate session storage and each complete login directly with the code.
- New-user first-login, new-space creation, and profiles/display_name behavior passed in v0.1.5 Production acceptance. The single-member-space path remains intentionally unverified.
- v0.1.6 recurrence rules are source-event metadata only. Existing event identity fields remain immutable; no recurrence table, occurrence materialization, exception model, RLS change, Realtime configuration change, reminder, or notification work is included. v0.1.6.2 projects only the current Today/Week/Month visible range and uses occurrence IDs only as display keys; v0.1.6.3 writes recurrence rules only on source events and labels all recurring edits/deletes as whole-series actions.
- The original v0.1.7 design is in `docs/RECURRENCE_EXCEPTIONS_DESIGN.md`. Its exception foundation, projection, database RPCs, and v0.1.7.3.3.2 only-this / this-and-future UI are implemented. Logical-series deletion UI remains deliberately deferred; exception Realtime publication remains future work.
- v0.1.7.1 foundation is present in the local schema and its 18-test pgTAP suite passes. v0.1.7.2 has a compatible reader/projection implementation. v0.1.7.3.2 adds only-this mutation UI, but intentionally omits split/end-from-here UI, logical-series deletion UI, and exception Realtime publication/subscriptions.
- v0.1.7.3 design treats `series_id` as the logical root and `parent_event_id` as the immediate predecessor. Exceptions stay attached to their original source segment; a split count-confirms and removes only old-segment exceptions made unreachable by the new cutoff. The actual exception schema uses `event_id`, `occurrence_date`, `exception_type`, and `override_data`.
- The final split RPC moves future exceptions to the child, consumes a split-day override, rejects a split-day deletion, preserves source recurrence rule/all-day, and requires the child to start on the selected occurrence date. The v0.1.7.3.3.2 client passes source rule/all-day unchanged and relies on the RPC for all transaction work.
- Final Production recurrence smoke passed on Desktop and iPhone Standalone PWA for all four supported occurrence actions. iOS Standalone PWA cannot actively refresh itself due to an iOS system limitation; this is not an application defect.
- `supabase/config.toml` uses a stable local `project_id`; the local database/API/Auth/Mailpit stack is reachable. It configures a local 8-digit Mailpit OTP template and port-5175 redirect URL only; the local status currently reports stopped imgproxy and pooler services, which do not block Postgres, Auth, Mailpit, or pgTAP validation.
- The engine uses native `Intl` IANA timezone formatting/conversion and rejects invalid rule shapes at both client and database boundaries. It returns an explicit error instead of a partial result after 500 candidates.

## Handoff Prompt

Commit the completed v0.1.7.3.3.2 work when ready. Do not add a `delete_logical_series` UI entry point without separate product approval; retain the backend RPC only. Continue any desired two-session Realtime and DST-zone verification separately.
