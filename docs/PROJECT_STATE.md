## Current version

v0.1.8.2 (Reminder Persistence + Ordinary Event Delivery — Architecture Frozen)

## Current status

Calendar Core 与 Recurring Events 已完成并通过 Production 验收。`v0.1.8.1 — Push Infrastructure Foundation` 保持 `CLOSED / PASS — Android final acceptance deferred`。`v0.1.8.2 — Reminder Persistence + Ordinary Event Delivery` 已完成 architecture / semantics freeze，但业务代码、SQL、migration、Cron 与 ordinary reminder delivery 实现均尚未开始。Android installed PWA 的完整 Push 生命周期仍延后到整个 v0.1.8 的最终 cross-platform acceptance，不阻塞 Slice 2。

## Latest completed

Completed the docs-only v0.1.8.2 architecture / semantics freeze. The superseded `events.reminder_offset_minutes` proposal is replaced by nullable `events.reminder_kind` plus nullable canonical IANA `events.time_zone`; new UI-created timed events default to `timed_10m_before`, new UI-created all-day events default to `all_day_same_day_08`, while all historical events remain `reminder_kind = null` and retain unknown `time_zone = null` unless a later explicit reminder/time edit establishes one. Timed/all-day conversion, start-only multi-day behavior, past-due skip, roughly ten-minute infrastructure grace, event-level recipients, due-aware idempotency, and Slice 3 recurrence inheritance were frozen without implementing business code, SQL, migration, Cron, or delivery.

## Next Action

进入 v0.1.8.2 implementation planning：按已冻结的 `reminder_kind + time_zone`、new-event defaults、historical-null migration、ordinary due calculation、delivery ledger、recipient resolution、Cron/sender、stale cancellation 与 grace 规则拆分可验证任务。Android installed PWA 的完整 Push 生命周期验收留到整个 v0.1.8 最终 cross-platform acceptance；recurring delivery 保留给 Slice 3。

## Blockers

暂无明确阻塞。

## Important Context

- Git branch、latest commit、working tree 由 project-command-center 实时 Git 扫描读取；PROJECT_STATE.md 不作为这些字段的权威来源。
- Production URL: `https://cross-platform-shared-calendar.vercel.app/`.
- Supabase project status is currently Active, but Free Tier inactivity pause remains an operational risk.
- A Supabase pause may affect Auth, Database, RLS, and Realtime until the project is restored.
- Vercel Cron 每天调用 `/api/supabase-keepalive`；每次调用连续执行 3 次极轻量、只读、无业务副作用的数据库检查；首次 Production Cron 已返回 HTTP 200 并完成验证。
- Keep-alive is active, but its long-term effectiveness against inactivity pauses still requires observation.
- Continue using Supabase Cloud for now; do not upgrade to Pro or migrate the backend unless real usage requires it.
- README is the project entrypoint; detailed smoke checklists and production validation records live in `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Android compatibility smoke test is complete for Xiaomi 14 / Android 16 / Chrome on mobile network.
- v0.1 is a Web/PWA, not native iOS / Android.
- Event ownership uses stable `scope + owner_user_id`; UI labels are derived from the current user.
- Personal events are visible to both members but only editable/deletable by the owner.
- Existing event identity fields must not change: `space_id`, `created_by`, `scope`, `owner_user_id`.
- Supabase RLS and database triggers remain the final permission boundary.
- v0.1.4 uses only `profiles.display_name`, which is nullable and constrained to trimmed 1–20-character values. UI fallback is 「成员」; shared remains 「共同」.
- New profiles default to a null display name, never an Auth metadata or email-derived public name.
- No `space_members.nickname`, no profile/member Realtime subscription, and no RLS policy changes were added. A name change updates the saving device immediately; other sessions refresh/re-enter to see it.
- The current Production Supabase patch and SQL/RLS verification passed on 2026-07-11. Local two-account desktop smoke and deployed-frontend Production desktop smoke passed.
- Resend SMTP + Supabase Auth passwordless template deliver 8-digit Email OTP in Production. Email OTP removes Magic Link return handling; Safari and standalone PWA retain separate session storage and each complete login directly with the code.
- New-user first-login, new-space creation, and profiles/display_name behavior passed in v0.1.5 Production acceptance. The single-member-space path remains intentionally unverified.
- v0.1.6 recurrence rules are source-event metadata only. Existing event identity fields remain immutable; no recurrence table, occurrence materialization, exception model, RLS change, Realtime configuration change, reminder, or notification work is included. v0.1.6.2 projects only the current Today/Week/Month visible range and uses occurrence IDs only as display keys; v0.1.6.3 writes recurrence rules only on source events and labels all recurring edits/deletes as whole-series actions.
- The original v0.1.7 design is in `docs/RECURRENCE_EXCEPTIONS_DESIGN.md`. Its exception foundation, projection, database RPCs, and v0.1.7.3.3.2 only-this / this-and-future UI are implemented. Logical-series deletion UI remains deliberately deferred; exception Realtime publication remains future work.
- v0.1.7.1 foundation is present in the local schema and its 18-test pgTAP suite passes. v0.1.7.2 has a compatible reader/projection implementation. v0.1.7.3.3.2 supports only-this and this-and-future mutation UI; logical-series deletion UI and exception Realtime publication/subscriptions remain deliberately deferred.
- v0.1.7.3 treats `series_id` as the logical root and `parent_event_id` as the immediate predecessor. The final split RPC moves future exceptions to the child, consumes a split-day override, rejects a split-day deletion, preserves source recurrence rule/all-day, and requires the child to start on the selected occurrence date. The actual exception schema uses `event_id`, `occurrence_date`, `exception_type`, and `override_data`; the v0.1.7.3.3.2 client relies on the RPC for all transaction work.
- Final Production recurrence smoke passed on Desktop and iPhone Standalone PWA for all four supported occurrence actions. iOS Standalone PWA cannot actively refresh itself due to an iOS system limitation; this is not an application defect.
- `supabase/config.toml` uses a stable local `project_id`; the local database/API/Auth/Mailpit stack is reachable. It configures a local 8-digit Mailpit OTP template and port-5175 redirect URL only; the local status currently reports stopped imgproxy and pooler services, which do not block Postgres, Auth, Mailpit, or pgTAP validation.
- The engine uses native `Intl` IANA timezone formatting/conversion and rejects invalid rule shapes at both client and database boundaries. It returns an explicit error instead of a partial result after 500 candidates.
- v0.1.8.2 supersedes the earlier `events.reminder_offset_minutes` proposal. One event-level nullable `events.reminder_kind` supports `timed_at_start`, `timed_10m_before`, `timed_30m_before`, `timed_1h_before`, `timed_previous_day_same_time`, `all_day_same_day_08`, and `all_day_previous_day_20`; `null` means no reminder. Multiple reminders, JSON reminder config, arbitrary custom minutes, and per-user reminder preferences remain outside this version.
- `events.time_zone` is the nullable canonical IANA timezone of the Event. New events detect it from the creating browser/PWA with standard `Intl` capability; later device timezone changes never silently rewrite an existing Event. Historical ordinary timezone remains null rather than guessed, while historical recurring sources may initialize it from their already-authoritative rule timezone. Recurring Event `time_zone` must equal `recurrence_rule.time_zone`, so there is only one authoritative timezone.
- New UI-created timed events default to `timed_10m_before`; new UI-created all-day events default to `all_day_same_day_08`. Database defaults and all historical events remain `reminder_kind = null`; historical ordinary Event timezone is not guessed or bulk-backfilled.
- Timed-to-all-day conversion maps a non-null timed reminder to `all_day_same_day_08`; all-day-to-timed maps a non-null all-day reminder to `timed_10m_before`; null remains null and the UI must show the resulting option. Multi-day reminders anchor only to the start and ignore `ends_at`.
- v0.1.8.1 Push Infrastructure is closed and passed on Desktop Chrome/macOS and iPhone installed PWA. `push_subscriptions` uses RPC-only authenticated browser writes, `send-test-push` owns server-side VAPID delivery, and the private key remains only in Supabase secrets. Safe diagnostics expose only upstream `status`, `delivered`, hostname-only `provider`, and `gone`. `@mmmike/web-push@1.3.0` remains an exact function-level dependency; no root/browser dependency was added.
- The initial Desktop Chrome subscription was abnormal/stale: FCM accepted the send (`201`, `delivered = true`) but no notification appeared. Closing notifications, unsubscribing, and creating a fresh subscription restored Desktop test-push delivery. For similar Push symptoms, try retry, unsubscribe/resubscribe, and browser/PWA restart before deeper RCA.
- Standard Web Push is the delivery channel. The Push Service Worker handles Push only and must not introduce offline caching. Desktop and iPhone Slice 1 acceptance passed; Android permission, subscription, foreground/background/closed-app delivery, notification click, and logout lifecycle are deferred together to final v0.1.8 cross-platform acceptance. This is a validation strategy, not a blocker.
- Push subscriptions bind to `user + installation`, never to a Space, and one user may retain multiple active device/browser subscriptions. This persistence model remains compatible with a future multi-space schema without implementing multi-space in v0.1.8.
- shared event reminders resolve current active Space members at send time; personal event reminders resolve only the current `owner_user_id`. A former member must not receive a delivery.
- v0.1.8 freezes a one-minute Supabase Cron + Edge Function sender architecture. Slice 2 will implement ordinary events; Slice 3 will dynamically project recurring occurrences through canonical recurrence/exception semantics without materializing a long horizon.
- Delivery idempotency is due-time aware: recurring `(logical_series_id, occurrence_key, subscription_id, due_at)` and one-off `(event_id, "once", subscription_id, due_at)`. A changed effective start/date or reminder preset may create a new legitimate delivery; unchanged `due_at` must not duplicate, including across a future split.
- A newly created/edited/enabled reminder whose derived `due_at` is already past is skipped without immediate Push or compensation. Normal target precision is about one minute; a roughly ten-minute grace window applies only to infrastructure delay. Web Push remains best-effort and is not an Alarm Clock.
- v0.1.8 excludes Email reminder delivery, SMS, Bark, multiple reminders, arbitrary custom minutes, snooze, sound customization, notification inbox/history, native alarms, and per-user reminder preferences. Email OTP authentication remains unchanged.
- `v0.1.9 Shared Tasks`, `v0.1.10 Shared Lists`, `v0.1.11 Important Dates / Anniversaries`, and `v0.1.12 Tags / Color = Who` are roadmap directions only, not frozen architectures. UI/UX overhaul remains deferred pending a Design System.

## Handoff Prompt

Begin v0.1.8.2 implementation planning from the approved reminder freeze. Plan nullable `reminder_kind`, nullable canonical IANA `time_zone`, UI-only new-event defaults (`timed_10m_before` / `all_day_same_day_08`), historical-null migration, ordinary-event due calculation, ledger, recipient resolution, Cron/sender, stale cancellation, and infrastructure-only grace. Review the safest minimal explicit-time-edit timezone behavior so an edit cannot accidentally reinterpret a timed event's absolute instant. Stop if the existing all-day presentation model cannot safely derive 08:00 from effective date plus canonical timezone. Keep recurring delivery for Slice 3 and keep Android final Push acceptance deferred to final v0.1.8 acceptance.
