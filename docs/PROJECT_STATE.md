## Current version

v0.1.8.2 (Phase 3 P3B send-reminders manual Production E2E — CLOSED / PASS; P3C not started)

## Current status

Calendar Core 与 Recurring Events 已完成并通过 Production 验收。`v0.1.8.1 — Push Infrastructure Foundation` 保持 `CLOSED / PASS — Android final acceptance deferred`。`v0.1.8.2` Slice A 与 Slice B 已关闭。P3A 已完成 C1 Production foundation：原始 C1 patch 成功创建空 ledger；经 ACL RCA 与 reviewed table-local corrective patch 后，`service_role` 仅有 SELECT / UPDATE，anon/authenticated 无直接访问，结构、RLS、function contract 与 existing-schema invariance 全部 PASS，因此 `C1_PRODUCTION_FOUNDATION = PASS`。P3B `send-reminders` 已部署为 ACTIVE 且 `verify_jwt=false`；缺失/无效 Bearer、授权 no-due、真实 personal Reminder E2E、iPhone 系统通知、Mac 恢复后的 send-test-push、幂等重复调用与 ledger postflight 全部 PASS。Edge `REMINDER_CRON_SECRET` 仅确认名称存在；Vault、pg_cron、pg_net 与 Reminder Cron 仍未配置或变更，Slice C 整体仍保持 OPEN。

## Latest completed

Completed the bounded P3B Production acceptance on canonical project `ximazjhxvmktpcdbypka`: `send-reminders` is ACTIVE with `verify_jwt=false`, application Bearer checks reject missing/invalid credentials, the authorized no-due run completed with zero work, and one disposable personal timed Reminder delivered to two active subscriptions. The iPhone received the real notification; Mac backend delivery succeeded while Sleep/Focus initially suppressed visible presentation, and send-test-push passed after that state was cleared. The repeat invocation produced two claim rejections with no duplicate delivery. Ledger postflight has two finalized `sent` rows, zero claimed/failed rows, zero duplicate identities, zero unexpected subscription disablement, and zero unexpected rows. C1 remains PASS; Cron is OFF; the Edge secret is confirmed by name only; Vault, pg_cron, and pg_net remain untouched.

## Deployment

Status: public_deployed
Public URL: https://cross-platform-shared-calendar.vercel.app/

## Next Action

Separately authorize P3C scheduler activation only: configure the Vault Reminder secret, enable `pg_cron` / `pg_net`, create one once-per-minute scheduler, verify scheduled runs, and retain an unschedule-first rollback rule. Do not begin recurring Reminder work or Android final acceptance without separate authorization.

## Blockers

暂无明确阻塞。

## Important Context

- Git branch、latest commit、working tree 由 project-command-center 实时 Git 扫描读取；PROJECT_STATE.md 不作为这些字段的权威来源。
- Production URL: `https://cross-platform-shared-calendar.vercel.app/`.
- Supabase project status is currently Active, but Free Tier inactivity pause remains an operational risk.
- A Supabase pause may affect Auth, Database, RLS, and Realtime until the project is restored.
- Vercel Cron 每天调用 `/api/supabase-keepalive`；每次调用连续执行 3 次极轻量、只读、无业务副作用的数据库检查；首次 Production Cron 已返回 HTTP 200 并完成验证。
- Keep-alive is active, but its long-term effectiveness against inactivity pauses still requires observation.
- Continue using Supabase Cloud for now; do not upgrade to Pro or migrate the backend unless real usage requires it.
- README is the project entrypoint; detailed smoke checklists and production validation records live in `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Android compatibility smoke test is complete for Xiaomi 14 / Android 16 / Chrome on mobile network.
- v0.1 is a Web/PWA, not native iOS / Android.
- Event ownership uses stable `scope + owner_user_id`; UI labels are derived from the current user.
- Personal events are visible to both members but only editable/deletable by the owner.
- Existing event identity fields must not change: `space_id`, `created_by`, `scope`, `owner_user_id`.
- Supabase RLS and database triggers remain the final permission boundary.
- v0.1.4 uses only `profiles.display_name`, which is nullable and constrained to trimmed 1–20-character values. UI fallback is 「成员」; shared remains 「共同」.
- New profiles default to a null display name, never an Auth metadata or email-derived public name.
- No `space_members.nickname`, no profile/member Realtime subscription, and no RLS policy changes were added. A name change updates the saving device immediately; other sessions refresh/re-enter to see it.
- The current Production Supabase patch and SQL/RLS verification passed on 2026-07-11. Local two-account desktop smoke and deployed-frontend Production desktop smoke passed.
- Resend SMTP + Supabase Auth passwordless template deliver 8-digit Email OTP in Production. Email OTP removes Magic Link return handling; Safari and standalone PWA retain separate session storage and each complete login directly with the code.
- New-user first-login, new-space creation, and profiles/display_name behavior passed in v0.1.5 Production acceptance. The single-member-space path remains intentionally unverified.
- v0.1.6 recurrence rules are source-event metadata only. Existing event identity fields remain immutable; no recurrence table, occurrence materialization, exception model, RLS change, Realtime configuration change, reminder, or notification work is included. v0.1.6.2 projects only the current Today/Week/Month visible range and uses occurrence IDs only as display keys; v0.1.6.3 writes recurrence rules only on source events and labels all recurring edits/deletes as whole-series actions.
- The original v0.1.7 design is in `docs/RECURRENCE_EXCEPTIONS_DESIGN.md`. Its exception foundation, projection, database RPCs, and v0.1.7.3.3.2 only-this / this-and-future UI are implemented. Logical-series deletion UI remains deliberately deferred; exception Realtime publication remains future work.
- v0.1.7.1 foundation is present in the local schema and its 18-test pgTAP suite passes. v0.1.7.2 has a compatible reader/projection implementation. v0.1.7.3.3.2 supports only-this and this-and-future mutation UI; logical-series deletion UI and exception Realtime publication/subscriptions remain deliberately deferred.
- v0.1.7.3 treats `series_id` as the logical root and `parent_event_id` as the immediate predecessor. The final split RPC moves future exceptions to the child, consumes a split-day override, rejects a split-day deletion, preserves source recurrence rule/all-day, and requires the child to start on the selected occurrence date. The actual exception schema uses `event_id`, `occurrence_date`, `exception_type`, and `override_data`; the v0.1.7.3.3.2 client relies on the RPC for all transaction work.
- Final Production recurrence smoke passed on Desktop and iPhone Standalone PWA for all four supported occurrence actions. iOS Standalone PWA cannot actively refresh itself due to an iOS system limitation; this is not an application defect.
- `supabase/config.toml` uses a stable local `project_id` and configures a local 8-digit Mailpit OTP template plus the port-5175 redirect URL. The local Docker/Supabase stack was recovered without reset or volume deletion; C1 pgTAP 63/63 and all database regressions 161/161 passed.
- The engine uses native `Intl` IANA timezone formatting/conversion and rejects invalid rule shapes at both client and database boundaries. It returns an explicit error instead of a partial result after 500 candidates.
- C2 Phase 2 pre-implementation review identified a reproducible DST-gap CPU blocker in the legacy 2161-point minute fallback. The corrective patch preserves the existing minute-grid outputs while using the fixed-point candidates to bracket and binary-search proven forward gaps. Same-machine 1000-call Deno improved from `7099.71 ms` to `144.06 ms`; human review passed and `DUE_CALCULATOR_CPU_BLOCKER = RESOLVED / PASS`.
- v0.1.8.2 supersedes the earlier `events.reminder_offset_minutes` proposal. One event-level nullable `events.reminder_kind` supports `timed_at_start`, `timed_10m_before`, `timed_30m_before`, `timed_1h_before`, `timed_previous_day_same_time`, `all_day_same_day_08`, and `all_day_previous_day_20`; `null` means no reminder. Multiple reminders, JSON reminder config, arbitrary custom minutes, and per-user reminder preferences remain outside this version.
- `events.time_zone` is the nullable canonical IANA timezone of the Event. New events detect it from the creating browser/PWA with standard `Intl` capability; later device timezone changes never silently rewrite an existing Event. Historical ordinary timezone remains null rather than guessed, while historical recurring sources may initialize it from their already-authoritative rule timezone. Recurring Event `time_zone` must equal `recurrence_rule.time_zone`, so there is only one authoritative timezone.
- New UI-created timed events default to `timed_10m_before`; new UI-created all-day events default to `all_day_same_day_08`. Database defaults and all historical events remain `reminder_kind = null`; historical ordinary Event timezone is not guessed or bulk-backfilled.
- Timed-to-all-day conversion maps a non-null timed reminder to `all_day_same_day_08`; all-day-to-timed maps a non-null all-day reminder to `timed_10m_before`; null remains null and the UI must show the resulting option. Multi-day reminders anchor only to the start and ignore `ends_at`.
- v0.1.8.1 Push Infrastructure is closed and passed on Desktop Chrome/macOS and iPhone installed PWA. `push_subscriptions` uses RPC-only authenticated browser writes, `send-test-push` owns server-side VAPID delivery, and the private key remains only in Supabase secrets. Safe diagnostics expose only upstream `status`, `delivered`, hostname-only `provider`, and `gone`. `@mmmike/web-push@1.3.0` remains an exact function-level dependency; no root/browser dependency was added.
- The initial Desktop Chrome subscription was abnormal/stale: FCM accepted the send (`201`, `delivered = true`) but no notification appeared. Closing notifications, unsubscribing, and creating a fresh subscription restored Desktop test-push delivery. For similar Push symptoms, try retry, unsubscribe/resubscribe, and browser/PWA restart before deeper RCA.
- Standard Web Push is the delivery channel. The Push Service Worker handles Push only and must not introduce offline caching. Desktop and iPhone Slice 1 acceptance passed; Android permission, subscription, foreground/background/closed-app delivery, notification click, and logout lifecycle are deferred together to final v0.1.8 cross-platform acceptance. This is a validation strategy, not a blocker.
- Push subscriptions bind to `user + installation`, never to a Space, and one user may retain multiple active device/browser subscriptions. This persistence model remains compatible with a future multi-space schema without implementing multi-space in v0.1.8.
- shared event reminders resolve current active Space members at send time; personal event reminders resolve only the current `owner_user_id`. A former member must not receive a delivery.
- v0.1.8 freezes a one-minute Supabase Cron + Edge Function sender architecture. Slice 2 will implement ordinary events; Slice 3 will dynamically project recurring occurrences through canonical recurrence/exception semantics without materializing a long horizon.
- Slice 2 ordinary-delivery idempotency is `(event_id, subscription_id, due_at)`. It does not add `occurrence_key`, pre-generate pending rows, mutate ledger rows when an Event schedule changes, or automatically retry provider failures. Recurring occurrence identity remains a Slice 3 decision.
- Slice C1 implementation, verification, human review, Production deployment, ACL correction, and final postflight are complete. The original patch created the empty durable ledger and atomic claim function; RCA isolated its ACL gate failure to the `postgres`/`public` default table ACL, and the reviewed table-local correction reduced `service_role` to SELECT / UPDATE only. `C1_PRODUCTION_FOUNDATION = PASS`. Audit rows intentionally have no Event/user/subscription foreign keys. The schedule marker must still round-trip at full PostgreSQL `timestamptz` precision.
- Slice C2 Phase 1 extracts Web Push sending into a server-only shared module with a closed safe result union and keeps `send-test-push` externally unchanged. Automated verification and Desktop/iPhone real-device regression passed after deploying only `send-test-push`. Repeated Desktop banners with the fixed `shared-calendar-test` tag are pre-existing/non-blocking; tag/renotify behavior remains unchanged. The later C2 scan must abort before claims/sends when enabled ordinary Events exceed 1000, and must sort eligible tasks by `due_at` ascending before capping at 50; no queue is added.
- Slice C2 Phase 2 `send-reminders` passed bounded human/code review with no BLOCKER / MAJOR / MINOR findings and completed P3B Production manual acceptance. It uses stable 100-row keyset pages plus an explicit 1001st-row probe, aborts overflow before recipient/claim/send work, preserves the raw C1 schedule marker, resolves current memberships and active subscriptions in batches, selects at most 50 tasks deterministically, uses five workers, and rechecks the 95-second budget immediately before claim acquisition. It adds no retry, lease, queue, recurring delivery, schema, or dependency. P3B delivered one iPhone Reminder, finalized two ledger rows, and passed idempotency; Mac visible delivery was initially suppressed by Sleep/Focus and later send-test-push regression passed after that state was cleared.
- A newly created/edited/enabled reminder whose derived `due_at` is already past is skipped without immediate Push or compensation. Normal target precision is about one minute; a roughly ten-minute grace window applies only to infrastructure delay. Web Push remains best-effort and is not an Alarm Clock.
- v0.1.8 excludes Email reminder delivery, SMS, Bark, multiple reminders, arbitrary custom minutes, snooze, sound customization, notification inbox/history, native alarms, and per-user reminder preferences. Email OTP authentication remains unchanged.
- `v0.1.9 Shared Tasks`, `v0.1.10 Shared Lists`, `v0.1.11 Important Dates / Anniversaries`, and `v0.1.12 Tags / Color = Who` are roadmap directions only, not frozen architectures. UI/UX overhaul remains deferred pending a Design System.

## Handoff Prompt

v0.1.8.2 P3B send-reminders manual Production E2E is `CLOSED / PASS`. P3A C1 remains PASS with `service_role` SELECT / UPDATE only and anon/authenticated denied. `send-reminders` is ACTIVE with source-controlled `verify_jwt=false`; missing/invalid Bearer checks, no-due invocation, real iPhone Reminder, Mac post-Sleep/Focus send-test-push regression, idempotency repeat, and two-row finalized ledger postflight all passed. The disposable Event is not present in the current aggregate check; no ledger rows were deleted. Cron remains OFF; the Edge secret is confirmed by name only; Vault, pg_cron, and pg_net remain untouched. Next: separately authorize P3C scheduler activation with Vault → pg_cron/pg_net → once-per-minute scheduler → scheduled-run verification → unschedule-first rollback.
